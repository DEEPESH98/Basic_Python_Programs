How do you reverse a string in Python?
Python
In Python, strings are ordered sequences of character data.

There is no built-in method to reverse a string. However, strings can be reversed in several different ways.


Methods
Three methods to reverse a string are explained below:

1. Slicing
Strings can be reversed using slicing. To reverse a string, we simply create a slice that starts with the length of the string, and ends at index 0.

To reverse a string using slicing, write:

stringname[stringlength::-1] # method 1 
Or write without specifying the length of the string:

stringname[::-1] # method2
The slice statement means start at string length, end at position 0, move with the step -1 (or one step backward).

str="Python" # initial string
stringlength=len(str) # calculate length of the list
slicedString=str[stringlength::-1] # slicing 
print (slicedString) # print the reversed string




2. Loop
To start, let’s create a new array called reversedString[].

We can then loop over the list with iterating variable index initialized with the length of the list.

In each iteration, concatenate value of str[index-1] with reverseString
Decrement the index.
We then simply keep iterating until the index is less than zero.

str = "Python" # initial string
reversedString=[]
index = len(str) # calculate length of string and save in index
while index > 0: 
    reverseString += str[ index - 1 ] # save the value of str[index-1] in reverseString
    index = index - 1 # decrement index
print(reversedString) # reversed string




3. Use join
This is a powerful technique that takes advantage of Python’s iterator protocol. This technique reverses a string using reverse iteration with the reversed() built-in function to cycle through the elements in the string in reverse order and then use .join() method to merge all of the characters resulting from the reversed iteration into a new string.

The general syntax is

str="Python" 
reversedstring=''.join(reversed(str))
The following Python code demonstrates the concept.


str = 'Python' #initial string
reversed=''.join(reversed(str)) # .join() method merges all of the characters resulting from the reversed iteration into a new string
print(reversed) #print the reversed string
